# Online-Library-System
This project is a web application that simulates a library. It was written in JavaScript and PHP, and uses a database to store book information and availability.

# Overview
In high school, I worked on a web project that simulated a library. The site was built using JavaScript and PHP and featured a user interface consisting of book cover tiles. Users could create an account, select a book, or search for one by author or title. Book availability information was retrieved from a database. Upon logging in as an administrator, the first tile would change to a special one that redirected to a page for adding new books. The website also had a sidebar that displayed the most popular books. This project was my favorite among all the ones I completed in school because I really enjoyed the final result, and I loved the look of it.
